# Learning-diary-of-Tensorflow
Today I'll start to learn to use tensorflow carefully.    
I try to master a programing language on my own, and use some relevant function.    
I also want to try my best to write these blogs in English.     
Now I'll start to write, in the hope of mutual encouragement with you.
